# Customer-Booking-Prediction-for-British-Airways
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will complete a holiday booking with British Airways (BA) based on historical booking data. The goal is to help the airline take proactive business decisions, improve marketing strategies, and increase customer acquisition by identifying patterns in booking behavior.

With thousands of customers interacting with BA daily, understanding who is likely to book a holiday is critical. The task is to:

Explore and clean the raw booking data

Train a predictive model to identify potential bookers

Interpret results to find key influencing factors

Present findings visually for business stakeholders
